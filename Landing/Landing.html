            We tried TutorTrack out of desperation — my son was failing algebra and felt completely lost. After a free intro session we were paired with Ana, who immediately diagnosed the gaps and created a simple, step‑by‑step plan. Ana used short whiteboard videos, weekly quizzes, and the TutorTrack progress dashboard so we could see exactly what improved. In eight weeks his quiz average went from 58% to 87%, and he now volunteers answers in class. Scheduling was a breeze and session recordings helped him review before tests. The price felt fair for the pace of progress.
